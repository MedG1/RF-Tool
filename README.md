# RF-tool
A GUI tool developed using Python and PyQt5 to calculate and provide basic impedence adapting circuits for  RF circuits.

#Feature:
- An interactive Smith Chart
- Calculate, generate solutions based on the operating frequency, characteristic impedence and either the load impedence or the reflection coefficient.
- A second tool to design and experiment with custom solutions.
